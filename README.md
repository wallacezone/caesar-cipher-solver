# caesar-cipher-solver
A simple Python script to decipher a string encoded with the Caesar cipher

This script was written to solve the 2nd step of the Python Challenge (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). Thus, it only accepts lowercase inputs and assumes that you know the encoded message and the alphabet shift.
